    <h2>
        <li>Workshop Summary</li>
    </h2>
    <p>
        This workshop is motivated by a fact: human beings have strong embodied intelligence in an open environment,
        but it is still challenging for large language models and LLM agents. Depsite some progresses on embodied AI
        on static and indoor environment, the LLM agents are still struggling in tasks in large-scale outdoor environment,
        such as navigation, search, spatial reasoning, task planning, etc. Therefore, we propose this workshop to discuss
        the recent advances on the related research area and looking forward to the future development. Specifically,
        it delves into topics of outdoor embodied intelligence, such as spatial intelligence and embodied perception,
        reasoning and planning, decision-making and action, multi-agent and human-agent collaboration, and the development
        of simulators, testbeds, datasets, and benchmarks. This comprehensive exploration of embodied LLM agents in open
        city environment holds the potential to advance the field of artificial intelligence and open up new applications
        in various domains.<i>We also have a special poster/short paper session for those solutions that perform best in
        the Open Urban Environment Embodied Intelligence Competition.</i>
    </p>
    <p>

    </ol>
    <h3>(6) Short paper / poster presentation for price winners of Open Urban Environment Embodied Intelligence Competition:</h3>
    <p>
        The organizer team have recently launched the competition with the benchmark platform named EmbodiedCity
        <a href="https://embodied-city.fiblab.net/" target="_blank">(https://embodied-city.fiblab.net/)</a>,
        a realistic, dynamic, and open platform for embodied intelligence,
        aimed at evaluating and researching its applications in complex urban scenarios. The benchmark consists of
        two components: a simulator and a dataset. The simulator is based on a large business district in Beijing,
        one of the largest cities in China, with 3D models of buildings, streets, greenery, statues, traffic flow, and
        other elements built using Unreal Engine 5. On the dataset side, we provide data and code for tasks related to
        multimodal scene understanding, question answering, dialogue, navigation, and task planning. The platform supports
        both online access and offline operation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The competition on the EmbodiedCity platform focused on "Intelligent Urban Navigation and Interaction".
        Participants will be challenged to develop and optimize embodied agents for efficient navigation and
        multimodal interaction in complex urban environments. Tasks include, but are not limited to:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Urban navigation by aerial/ground agents,</li>
        <li>Multi-agent natural language dialogue,</li>
        <li>Completing designated tasks in diverse urban scenarios.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Outstanding participants will be featured in a special poster session showcasing the most advanced urban
        embodied agent designs and corresponding insights. The are also encouraged to submit the solution via a
        short paper (will be peer-reviewed before acceptance). The platform does not needs huge compuation power
        for partipants, which accords to one of original purposes: to encourage researchers who lack the computing
        power to publish long papers.

    </h2>
    <li><strong>Anticipated audience size.</strong>Based on our experience in hosting workshops, our attendance experience
        in past ICLR conferences, and the attractiveness of the speakers, we expect the workshop to host 150-200 people in
        the room at all times and cover 300-400 audiences in total throughout the event. <strong>Plan to get an audience for a workshop
            (advertising, reaching out, etc.):</strong></li>
    <ol>
        <li>We are going to establish the official social media account (X, Facebook, etc.), along with the official website,
            to help reach out the audience.
        </li>
        <li>We will continuously advertise the workshop in related venues including NeurIPS 2024, etc.</li>
        <li>The call-for-paper message will be broadly sent via emails.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><strong>Diversity commitment.</strong>We strive to achieve balance and parity across multiple levels–from seniority
        levels, field/community, position/location, to personal backgrounds for invited speakers, organizing team, covered topics,
        and targeted audiences.
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Seniority level.</strong>The organization team has spanned the full range of seniority from full professor to postdoctoral
                researcher. The invited speakers/panelists span the full range of seniority from the assistant professor to the full professor level.

            <li><strong>Field/community.</strong>The organization team and the invited speaker/panelists cover the various community from
                computer science, artificial intelligence to psychology and behavioral science (Stella). As for computer science and artificial
                intelligence, the research area is also very diverse, covering from the machine learning theory, computer vision, large language model,
                data mining, machine learning engineering, etc.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Position/location and personal backgrounds for invited speaker.</strong>(3)We have organizers and invited speakers from different
                continents, speaking different languages. Our female organizers and invited speakers covers from different seniority level
                (postdoc, assistant professor, and professor), which we believe well encourage different background female partipants to join
                our workshop. We have also speaker from industry (Micrsoft).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Covered topics and targeted audiences.</strong> The invited talks are from diverse speakers, and it naturally
                attract diverse audiences. In addition, in our call-for-paper, we setup multiple topics related to the embodied intelligence
                in open environment.

    <li><strong>Virtual access to workshop materials and outcome. </strong>We build one official website: embodied-workshop.fib-lab.net,
        which help easily access all related materials.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Previous related workshops. </strong>There is one related workshop: Workshop on Open-World Agents (OWA-2024) in NeurIPS 2024,
        of which we have one overlapped organizer: Litao Liang. But, however, our proposed workshop is largely differnet from multiple aspects.
        First, the proposed workshop focues on the open city environment while "open" in OWA-2024 only refers to open-ended tasks. Second, the
        proposed workshop pay more attention to embodied intelligence and large language model.
